# Magento Bing-Translate (Product Attribute translation)
Magento Bing-Translate extension is designed to automatically translate product attributes like short-description, descriptions into multiple languages through the translation tool incorporated in the Magento admin panel. With this extension store admins can easily and quickly translate product attributes for their stores into any language supported by Bing Translate. The extension is powered by Microsoft ¬Bing’s API which offers a free Online translation feature.
